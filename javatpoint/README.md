### Install script for sidebar menu

The script [restore-menu-scroll.js](restore-menu-scroll.js) automatically restores the last scroll position of the `#menu` sidebar element after page reload and makes the site navigation more comfortable.

To use this script you need a browser addon which enables to inject JS code into a given web site. A good one is [Code Injector](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector). Follow the documentation and insert the content of the JS script into an addon rule.
